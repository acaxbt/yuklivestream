# Project Restored to Working State

## Restoration Details
- **Target Commit**: 9fa4b35 (chore: remove unused WebRTCPlayer component)
- **Date**: July 9, 2025
- **Reason**: Restore to working mobile video streaming state

## What This Commit Contains
This is the last known working state where:
- ✅ Mobile browser video streaming works properly
- ✅ Front camera streams to viewers successfully
- ✅ Audio streaming works correctly
- ✅ Simple, stable codebase without complex features

## GoLivePage.tsx Features (Working Version)
- Simple getUserMedia constraints
- Basic Daily.co integration
- No complex quality selectors or debugging
- Clean 152-line implementation
- Mobile-friendly responsive design

## Key Differences from Previous Complex Version
- **No quality selectors** - Uses fixed high-quality settings
- **No aspect ratio controls** - Uses standard 16:9 aspect ratio
- **No health check utilities** - Focuses on core streaming functionality
- **No excessive logging** - Minimal, clean console output
- **No mobile-specific constraints** - Uses standard video constraints

## Testing Status
- ✅ Application starts successfully (port 3002)
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Clean codebase without unused imports
- ✅ Ready for mobile video streaming testing

## Next Steps
1. Test on mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
2. Verify video stream appears in viewer player
3. Confirm audio quality is maintained
4. Monitor for any issues
